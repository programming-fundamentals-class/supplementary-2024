Students can suggest extra projects to implement. But each project has to fit the following criterion.

### Mandatory reqs
- [ ] Fully operable through terminal/command-line interface
- [ ] Utilize Linux-specific system calls, APIs, or filesystem features
- [ ] Scope should be substantial enough but still achievable in 3 weeks
- [ ] Implementation should require meaningful use of data structures
- [ ] Project should have at least three clear use cases
- [ ] Features must be testable

### Optional reqs
- [ ] Implementation should benefit from C's capabilities (like low-level memory management, direct system access)
- [ ] Project involves system resource handling (files, processes, memory, or network)
