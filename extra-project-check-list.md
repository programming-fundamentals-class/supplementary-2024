- [ ] Utilize Linux-specific system calls, APIs, or filesystem features
- [ ] Scope should be substantial enough but still achievable in 3 weeks
- [ ] Implementation should require meaningful use of data structures
- [ ] Project should have at least three clear use cases
- [ ] Features must be testable

### Optional reqs
